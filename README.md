# Ada_Roller
On my 4th team rotation on my Year In Industry I rewrote my [C_Roller](https://github.com/Jensen6842/C_Roller) to learn Ada.
This version of the program involves using vectors and records to seperate the parser function from the roller function so that if you run an expression multiple times it doesn't need to be reparsed, improving time metrics.
